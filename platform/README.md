## Platform Developer

As a Platform Developer, you will play a key part in the development of our client-facing projects and join the team as we take on our most exciting leap in technology since forming as a business in 2013. 

You will work as part of a close-knit, growing team in Mabo's R&D department and be responsible for working alongside colleagues in other departments, partner agencies and our clients directly to deliver our award-winning level of service with a brand new product.

We work with a range of technologies and the opportunity to learn new skills and programming languages is ever-present. We currently work with the following technology and whilst we don't expect you to be familiar with them all, experience in working with some items below would be beneficial;

* Experience working with PHP (OOP)
* Experience using MySQL
* Experience using a Content Management System (à la WordPress)
* Knowledge JavaScript
* Knowledge of MVC (Laravel, or similar)
* Awareness external APIs (REST/SOAP)

As developers, the paths that we have taken to become who we are, know what we know and do what we do may differ, but our vision is the same: to write code that makes a difference. With that path in mind, it makes sense that we like to showcase how we make a difference in different ways – it could be a GitHub profile, a previous project or portfolio, or documented in a CV.

We craft our best code when we're happy, as part of our development team we'll provide you;

* Mix of remote working and from our Middlesbrough HQ (once our office re-opens),
* Competitive salary (up to £30,000 DOE), with annual compensation review, and company pension,
* A wide range of projects, with the opportunity to train with partners such as Google and Microsoft,
* Dedicated hours for training and innovation,
* An additional personal training budget each year,
* An employee bonus scheme.

The role is 7.5 hours per day, Monday to Friday and currently based entirely remotely and will be a mix of remote and working from our Middlesbrough HQ, when our office reopens.
