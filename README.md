## Welcome to Mabo

Hello there, we're Mabo 👋🏼

We're a specialist PPC agency based in the North East of the UK (Middlesbrough, to be exact).

As developers at Mabo, we take great pride in building technology that makes a difference – for our staff, for our business and for our clients. In a fast moving landscape, the need to innovate is ever-present.

We'd like you to join us in that innovation, as we embark on our biggest technical leap yet.

We firmly believe in transparency, so we've tried to include as much information as possible within these docs to give you the best possible idea of what life is like here at Mabo (be it working from our HQ or remote).

That said, if you have any questions, be sure to get in touch!

## Current Roles

There's full info on each of our roles in their respective folders of this repo, but here's an overview.

### R&D Developers

As an R&D Developer, you'll strive to continuously improve our business from within – through expanding current and building new platforms and automation tools. We've previously built Comparison Shopping Services, data management platforms and an intranet. Critical thinking is key as you explore new ideas and new ways to push the boundaries of our field.

### Platform Developers

As a Platform Developer, you'll play a key role in developing a brand new service, working directly with our partner agencies and clients to build Mabo as a business and better our clients online.

## Thinking of applying?

We're always on the lookout for developers with the desire to learn and grow with us as a company. You'll find info on all of our roles within this repo, but consider these guidelines - if you'd like to be a part of something exciting, let's talk!
