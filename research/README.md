## Platform Developer

As an R&D Developer, you play a key part in pioneering technology that improves Mabo as a company from within.

You will work as part of a close-knit, growing team in Mabo's R&D department and be responsible for expanding our current in-house technology, working with a range of APIs as well as developing new internal platforms that improve efficiency and optimise our client's advertising performance across a range of channels.

* Experience working with PHP (OOP)
* Experience using MySQL
* Knowledge of working with external APIs (REST/SOAP)
* Knowledge of Laravel, or a similar MVC framework
* Knowledge of a Content Management System (à la WordPress)
* Understanding of JavaScript

As developers, the paths that we have taken to become who we are, know what we know and do what we do may differ, but our vision is the same: to write code that makes a difference. With that path in mind, it makes sense that we like to showcase how we make a difference in different ways – it could be a GitHub profile, a previous project or portfolio, or documented in a CV.

We craft our best code when we're happy, as part of our development team we'll provide you;

* Mix of remote working and from our Middlesbrough HQ (once our office re-opens),
* Competitive salary (up to £30,000 DOE), with annual compensation review, and company pension,
* A wide range of projects, with the opportunity to train with partners such as Google and Microsoft,
* Dedicated hours for training and innovation,
* An additional personal training budget each year,
* An employee bonus scheme.

The role is 7.5 hours per day, Monday to Friday and currently based entirely remotely and will be a mix of remote and working from our Middlesbrough HQ, when our office reopens.
